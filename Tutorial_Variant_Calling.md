# Tutorial

This page describes how to use the code provided to do sex-aware variant calling using the test data files from Genome in a Bottle using the telomere-to-telomere reference genome (CHM13v2).

# Download DNA sequencing data for testing



# Clone Repository to get required code

# Setting up environment using Docker to get required software

# Create custom config for DNA data

# Verify sex chromosome complement of samples

# Perform variant calling
